A professional computer programmer and a full-time spiritual practitioner, Jack deeply understands that technology is playing an ever-increasing role in our lives and in the shape of human culture. Through his long-term practices of meditation with the Clairvision School, he has studied the effects of technology on human consciousness, and the intersections of the two in our society. It is his vision that the power of networks, and the social impact of the information flows within them, are some of the keys which will allow us to move to the next level of human evolution -- emerging as a global consciousness. In order to do that, he sees that we will need to continue developing our tools of communication, and steer them in the directions that will greatest facilitate healthy consciousness and awakening of understanding.

Toward that end, Enlightened Structure will provide a resource for open communication across the Internet. It will also lend way to information organization resting on natural principles of physics and consciousness. Jack brings to Enlightened Structure a tremendous spiritual vision and integrity, paired with a deep technical know-how.
