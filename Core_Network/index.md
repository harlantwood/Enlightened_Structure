&emdash; A visual isomorphism engine &emdash;

The Core Network is a visual node browser based on the geometry and physics of space-time itself.  It traces our interactions and relationships with information displayed using colors and geometric shapes, while organizing them by shared keywords, categories, and proximity references. 

The geometric system interface functions like a multidimensional map, with each user at the center of their own personal browser.  The user's social and information networks, from people to bookmarked websites, surround them a color-coded geometric matrix.  Items they  interact with regularly position themselves adjacent to their "self" position in the honeycomb grid,  while items they interact with less often are displayed further away.  Each node and connection in the grid self-organizes by semantic anaysis.

The map is rendered and displayed with physics-based movement and reorients itself according to your searches or general navigation.  The geometric structure can be rendered in 2D and 3D, and display changes in interactions over time.
