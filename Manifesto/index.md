Manifesto
=========

The goal of enlightened structure is to facilitate the emergence of an ecosystem of technologies
and systems that make the world a better place. We will do this by creating a basic infrastructure
of key technologies that will enable the desired ecosystem to self-organize.

We see a number of powerful technologies that when realized could dramatically improve the quality
of life on Earth, the democracy of our societies, the robustness and affluence of our economies,
and the integrity with which we conduct our daily business. Rather than creating all of these
technologies, we will create a common foundation upon which they can easily be built by others.
This is our fulcrum for leverage, our minimal effort for maximum result. We will work up from
fundamental principles creating just what is needed to enable the desired emergent behavior.

Fundamental principles
======================

Distribution is robustness. Distribution baked into every aspect of the systems we build. Human
readability and machine readability, everything is content addressable, built on node graphs, with
more effective means of traversal. Trust is a fundamental filter, building on the networks to
pre-curating content for you through your trust cones.

The fundamental pieces of technology that we have identified:

From scarcity to abundance
From hierarchy to federation
From ownership to stewardship
From competition to transclusion

Distributed
Open and transparent
Networked
Information represented as a graph
Content addressability
All data is accessible and transportable

What are the mechanisms of localization?
========================================
Federations of federations
Balanced interactions
Flexible boundaries
Grassroots distribution of power and decentralization
Emergent organization behavior
Autonomy
The right to define and enforce boundaries
