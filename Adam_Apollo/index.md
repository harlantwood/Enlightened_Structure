Adam Apollo has offered insights on consciousness development, physics, future technology, and planetary transitions at the White House, in a United Nations summit, and at conferences and festivals around the world. He awoke to a complete library of Sacred Geometry and Metaphysical knowledge at the age of 15, and spent many years afterwards teaching and integrating this information through developing deep personal research and martial arts practices.

He designed the interface that started the CORE Network as he worked to develop a way to model advanced structural models of energy in theoretical physics that would apply to both principles of Loop Quantum Gravity and Superstring Theory.

Adam is dedicated to Earth healing and Global environmental, social, and economic sustainability.
